# 🧠 SkillBridge – Learn, Earn & Certify on Web3

![SkillBridge Logo](./SkillBridgeDApp/public/skillbridgedapp-logo.jpg)

> SkillBridge is a decentralized learning platform that enables students to earn tokens, enroll in Web3-powered courses, get instant AI-powered help, and mint verifiable NFT certificates upon completion. Built on blockchain and IPFS, SkillBridge redefines ownership, trust, and motivation in online education.

## 🔎 Real Problem We Solve (Personal Story)

*"I once bought a course on a Web2 platform like Udemy, completed it, and downloaded the certificate. Later, while applying for a blockchain internship, I submitted this certificate. But the recruiter asked me, 'Can you prove this is real?' That hit me. Anyone can fake a PDF. There's no public proof or ownership."*

**Web2 Certificate Issues:**

* Can be easily edited/faked (e.g., in Photoshop)
* No public verification mechanism
* No ownership or on-chain record

**We built SkillBridge to fix this.**

**Web3 NFT Certificates:**

* Minted on-chain to your wallet
* Publicly verifiable
* Tamper-proof and immutable

We also solved another pain point:

> "During online courses, whenever I had doubts, I commented under the video. Often, no one responded or it took days. It felt disconnected."

**So we added:**

* 🧠 **AI-powered chatbots per course** trained on that course's content
* ⏱ Instant doubt solving
* 📊 No waiting for instructors

## 👉 Smart Contracts

Located in `/contracts`:

* `SkillBridgeToken.sol` — ERC-20 token for platform (SKL)
* `SkillBridgeNFT.sol` — ERC-721 NFT for certificates
* `SkillBridgeMain.sol` — Controls user state, course access, test scores

### 🔧 Compile & Deploy

```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat compile

## 🧠 AI-Powered Course Chatbot

* Instructor clicks **Ingest Vector** to upload course content
* Learner can instantly chat via **CourseAIChat**
* Uses OpenAI + ChromaDB vector DB for semantic understanding

---

## 📅 NFT Certificate Flow

1. Learner finishes course and passes quiz
2. Result sent to backend
3. Backend:

   * Generates certificate image via `node-html-to-image`
   * Uploads image + metadata to IPFS
   * Mints NFT via ERC-721 smart contract
